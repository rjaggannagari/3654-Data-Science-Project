Description

In this project, we intend to scrape data from the internet on the Pokémon Pokedex and get each Pokémon’s weaknesses, strengths, statistics, and abilities. From there, we will merge additional data from the internet on specific Pokémon to give us more information to work on. By the end of this project, we will be able to know which Pokémon types are the strongest, which abilities correlate with the best statistics, best Pokémon per type with/without legendary Pokémon. This information is useful since many of the digital Pokémon games are based on this information and doing data analysis on it will be useful to users to know which Pokémon fits their playstyles and strengths.

Potential Research Questions

Which Pokemon abilties correlate to the best statistics? What are the best Pokemon per type not including legendary Pokemon? Depending on which statistics you value the most, what is the best Pokemon per type for your playstyle? Which legendary Pokemon has the best base statistics? How do multiple typing Pokemon cluster depending on their types and abilities? Per each digital Pokemon game, what is the strongest team that you will be able to create?
